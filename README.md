## üìå Project Overview

> _‚ÄúEnterprise-Ready Testing & Integration Framework Using Watermelon (WM)‚Äù_  
> This project explores how Watermelon acts as a centralized testing and integration management platform, helping teams streamline quality assurance and collaboration across SDLC tools. The platform was configured and analyzed for real-time testing workflows, tool integrations, and report generation.

This project was developed to simulate a real-world enterprise tool evaluation and configuration experience, focusing on Watermelon‚Äôs core role in improving testing efficiency and cross-team collaboration.

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand real-time testing lifecycle in enterprise environments.
- Learn how centralized platforms (like Watermelon) integrate with tools such as **JIRA**, **Jenkins**, **Azure DevOps**, and **TestRail**.
- Configure and analyze RBAC, data sources, ALM, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Present project implementation using professional documentation and visual models (UML, Use Case Diagrams).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Scope

- Implemented WM-Meta configuration including global tools and RBAC.
- Integrated IDPs like **Active Directory** and **Okta** via **Keycloak**.
- Demonstrated functionality through test cases, traceability, and visual dashboards.
- Highlighted Agile methodology support and test workflow automation.

---

## üß™ Methodologies Applied

- **Agile and Scrum Frameworks**: Iterative approach for testing and feedback.
- **Waterfall (for initial configuration)**: Sequential stages for WM setup.
- **Testing in WM**:
  - Functional and regression test case execution.
  - Traceability matrix generation.
  - Integration-based validation with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Watermelon‚Äôs Role**:
  - Unifies testing and reporting across multiple tools.
  - Enables centralized control of test lifecycles and traceability.
